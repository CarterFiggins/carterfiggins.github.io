          In the coding arena, I'm a Pokémon Trainer at <b><a href="https://www.atomicjolt.com/" target="blank" className="link-in-text">Atomic Jolt</a>!</b> I
          train with the versatile Pikachu, ⚡️<b>JavaScript</b>⚡️, who zaps through challenges. With 🔥<b>Ruby</b>🔥 the Charizard, I breathe fiery solutions into
          existence. 🐍<b>Python</b>🐍, the cunning Arbok, dives deep into problems. And 🦫<b>Go</b>🦫, the swift Bidoof, evolves into intricate systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my coding journey is far from over! Just as Pikachu electrifies with "Thunderbolt", 🌩️<b>React</b>🌩️ charges my code battles with lightning-fast adaptability! 🧠<b>GraphQL</b>🧠 channels the strategic wisdom of "Mind Reader", mapping my path with precision. 🛡️<b>Ruby On Rails</b>🛡️ transforms into the unyielding shield of "Iron Defense", warding off coding challenges. 🔮 <b>Vue</b>🔮 , akin to the mystic powers of "Future Sight", casts a charming spell on interfaces, weaving a prophecy of innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>ORM frameworks</b> powers every query, data interaction, and relationship mapping that becomes the silent force that ensures victory in the coding arena. <b>PostgreSQL</b> brings the earth-shattering force of "Earthquake", reshaping my coding landscape. Just as Eevee demonstrates teamwork through "Helping Hand", <b>Git</b> rallies my coding crew with its harmonizing "Symphony of Sync"!
