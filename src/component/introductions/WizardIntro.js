          Greetings, fellow wizards and witches! I am a digital spellcaster at the esteemed <b><a href="https://www.atomicjolt.com/" target="blank" className="link-in-text">Atomic Jolt</a></b>, where for four magical years, I have practiced the arcane arts of full-stack development. My enchanted tools and charms bring forth wondrous Learning Management Systems, empowering the pursuit of knowledge across our enchanted realm.

        <p>
          Within my grimoire of programming spells, you'll find the incantations of Javascript, the reliable Node.js, the sturdy PostgreSQL, the ever-changing React.js, the swift Go, the cloud-bound AWS, the multifaceted Ruby on Rails, and the structured Typescript. Each spell, a testament to my wizarding prowess, conjures solutions to the most intricate of digital challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my leisure, I conjure mystical Discord bots that host games like Werewolf, captivating minds and spirits alike, much like the enchanting games of wizard chess. My quest for knowledge in the vast and mystical field of computer science is unending, driving me to continually expand my magical repertoire.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not weaving spells, I embark on exhilarating broomstick adventures, navigating rugged terrains much like a Muggle on a mountain bike. This thrilling pursuit allows me to find balance and harmony in the great outdoors.
